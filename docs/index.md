# Background

Large language models offer state-of-the-art performance across many NLP tasks, but their massive size poses significant challenges for efficient deployment. Quantization techniques help reduce memory and computation cost by compressing model weights into low-bit representations. Among these, QTIP (Quantization with Trellises and Incoherence Processing) stands out as a recent method that combines Gaussianization and trellis-based encoding to achieve high-quality 2–4 bit quantization. For more details, see the QTIP paper: [QTIP: Quantization with Trellises and Incoherence Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11235).

At the same time, [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is an open-source, high-throughput inference engine designed to serve LLMs efficiently using features like PagedAttention and kernel fusion. However, it does not natively support advanced quantization methods like QTIP.

This project focuses on integrating QTIP into vLLM’s inference pipeline. The work includes decoding the QTIP compression logic, writing a full Python implementation, modifying vLLM’s linear layer to support QTIP-based quantized weights and testing. The result is a hybrid system that combines algorithmic innovation with systems-level engineering, enabling lower latency inference while maintaining model accuracy.
